## A Chart library based on d3 - POC
There was idea to make TypeScript library for d3 js. 
POC shown that it is not very usable, but sources left, and here they are.

### Run locally
After you installed node js and installed dependencies via ```npm i```, and want to run locally to see http://localhost:8080/build
```
npm run start
```

### Build
Build will be done to './build' directory
```
npm run build
```

### Notes
Here is webpack sample with splitting library to external file
